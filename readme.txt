= Why Use this Plugin? =

This plugin allows you to display Google reviews on your WordPress website. Why is this important? Positive reviews on websites like Google help businesses gain additional exposure and further enhance their online credibility. A [recent study](http://marketingland.com/survey-customers-more-frustrated-by-how-long-it-takes-to-resolve-a-customer-service-issue-than-the-resolution-38756) conducted by Dimensional Research found that the buying decisions of 90% of consumers are influenced by positive online reviews. Additionally, a [2012 study published on Search Engine Land](http://searchengineland.com/study-72-of-consumers-trust-online-reviews-as-much-as-personal-recommendations-114152 "View the Article Online") found that 72% of consumers trust online reviews as much as personal recommendations. If you do the research it quickly becomes clear. Positive reviews add substantial credibility to any business and can lead to increased conversion rates and higher sales.

There is significant data that shows how much consumers care about online reviews but very little information about what businesses are doing to respond to this phenomenon. How about displaying reviews on your WordPress website from Google?

Google Places Reviews allows you to display up to 3 business reviews with the free version and 5 with the Pro version. Setup is quick and easy. Simply install the plugin, insert your Google API (free and documented), and drag the widget into any sidebar to configure the options.

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. That's it! You should now be able to use the widget.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why does the widget look funny in my theme? =

Most likely your theme has conflicting CSS that is interfering with the themes included with the plugin. If you're handy with CSS this can be an easy fix. If you are new to CSS then try out the Bare Bones theme to see if that looks nicer. Otherwise, you may have to hit up your coding friends to help you out.

= Are style (CSS) and/or theme compatibility issues supported? =

We do our best to support the free version of the plugin but it's not our priority. The premium plugin is where we spend most of our support time. If you are experiencing a style issue and need help, either upgrade to the Premium version or post in the WordPress.org support forum and we will do our darnedest to get it set up nicely for your theme.

= Are there prebuilt styles included in the plugin? =

Yes, there are three basic themes included in the free version of the plugin. The premium version has many more options and themes.
